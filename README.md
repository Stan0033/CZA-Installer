 CZA Installer is a simple tool that lets you pack a folder into a single .cza file with no compression, and later extract it.
It works both as an installer maker and as the installer itself.

Create installer: Run the .exe to build a .cza file from a folder. You’ll need to provide a title, year, and header image (215x460 recommended).

Run installer: Associate .cza files with the app and double-click to extract.

The .cza file includes all content, plus metadata like title, year, and image—ideal for storing games or apps as a single file.

Hotkeys:

Esc — close the app (if not processing)

F1 — show file list
