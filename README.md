 This is an app that can serve as both installer maker, and installer.

 
When does it serve as installer maker? 
- when you start it from the .exe

When does it serve as installer?
- when you associate .cza file with the app and double-click on a .cza file

  
What is .cza File?
- CZA File is an un-compressed archive file format that contains all data that is to be installed. It also contains the title, the year, the header image and the listfile.

  
How to use install maker?
- it requires image, title, and year and to file input. You can get the image by clicking on the black space. You can input the others manually. You can input file by clicking on the [...]. Preferably let the image be 215x460 (like a header from Steam)


I made this app to store various games and apps as a single file that can be unpacked later. (for practicality).

Hotkeys:
- Esc - close the app if it's not generating or extracting
- F1 - show the listfile
